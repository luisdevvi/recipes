  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Cocada is a popular street food sold everywhere in Brazil.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
    <li>1/2 can sugar (use sweetened condensed milk can as measure)</li>
    <li>3 cups grated fresh coconut</li>
    <li>Â½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine condensed milk, sugar, coconut, and vanilla extract in a large saucepan. Heat over medium-low heat,
      stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and becomes a little darker. If you find that the cocada is
      cooking too quickly, reduce heat to low and continue stirring.</li>
    <li>Once the mixture has thickened enough and feels heavy on the spoon, remove from heat and place spoonfuls on a
      piece of parchment paper.</li>
    <li>Let cool for about 30 minutes (cocada will harden a bit) and transfer to a sealed container.</li>
  </ol>
